# Launch Gap Register

This is the release gate for Rakshex. A checked item is implemented and verified in the repository. An external item requires an account owner or provider console and cannot be truthfully completed from source code alone.

**Updated:** 2026-07-30 — product code complete; operator items only.

## Implemented In Code

- [x] Workspace-scoped provider accounts, encrypted credentials, subscription seats, and cloud-resource inventory.
- [x] Metadata-only local discovery with fingerprints and masking.
- [x] Workspace usage rollups by user and model.
- [x] Runtime policy preview for budgets, provider/model allowlists, PII redaction, prompt-injection signals, tools, and kill switches.
- [x] Provider capability labels that distinguish connected, imported, estimated, and unavailable data.
- [x] Public waitlist route, persistence failure handling, confirmation-email attempt, and regression test.
- [x] Configurable beta countdown through `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_DATE`.
- [x] Public trust center, security.txt, SEO metadata, robots, and sitemap alignment.
- [x] CI type checks, server tests, frontend build, VS Code type checks, and Playwright smoke coverage.
- [x] Customer-facing Terms, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, DPA, enterprise SLA, Acceptable Use Policy, Refund Policy, Subprocessor Register, and AI Transparency Statement drafted.
- [x] Operational incident, privacy-request, retention, vendor-review, continuity, and legal-sign-off runbooks.
- [x] Railway production project with PostgreSQL, Redis, production secrets, health check, Drizzle migration gate.
- [x] Residual DevPulse branding removed from user-facing runtime (FAQ, CORS, vault messaging, pitch, billing runbook).
- [x] Feature maturity: all shippable surfaces **Available** (`docs/FEATURE_MATURITY.md`).

## Required Before Public Launch (operator)

- [x] Run SQL migrations against production PostgreSQL and verify journal.
- [x] Configure 32+ character `JWT_SECRET` and `RAKSHEX_VAULT_KEY` (never development defaults).
- [x] Configure `DATABASE_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `APP_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and production CORS origins on backend host.
- [ ] Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_TS_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, optional `NEXT_PUBLIC_LAUNCH_DATE` in Vercel.
- [ ] Configure live Razorpay and/or Stripe keys, webhook secrets, products/prices, and execute a real payment/refund test (if selling paid).
- [ ] Configure SMTP or transactional email, verify `security@rakshex.in` / `support@rakshex.in`, submit a real waitlist request.
- [ ] Configure GitHub OAuth, Google OAuth, GitHub App installation, webhook secret, and callback URLs for production domains (if using those paths).
- [ ] Configure Sentry, uptime monitoring, backups, and a status-page owner.
- [x] Railway backend service, database, Redis, public health, migration gate verified.
- [ ] Configure provider connectors with customer-authorized OAuth/admin credentials; do not add provider secrets to the frontend.
- [ ] Obtain qualified legal review and complete legal-entity, GST, registered-address, named-grievance-officer, and authorised-signatory fields in `docs/operations/LEGAL_LAUNCH_SIGNOFF.md` before paid public orders.

## Commercial Follow-Through

- [ ] Verify tax/GST treatment, invoices, refund flow, dunning, and annual-contract process.
- [ ] Record a permitted customer reference before publishing a logo, quotation, benchmark, or savings claim.
- [ ] Run a clean-environment deployment and a complete buyer journey: waitlist, sign-in, workspace creation, scan, inventory, budget alert, payment, and data export.
- [ ] Publish a named on-call owner, tested security/privacy role email aliases, and incident communications process.

## What You May Need To Buy

- Production database and Redis capacity if the existing hosting plan does not include them.
- Transactional email service and a verified sending domain.
- Error monitoring and uptime monitoring plans if free tiers do not meet retention or alerting needs.
- Customer-contract tooling or legal review for enterprise DPA/SLA/security terms.
- Provider subscriptions or enterprise plans only where official admin APIs, SCIM, audit logs, or invoice exports require them.

The domains, source code, and deployment manifests are already present. These items are paid-account configuration or legal/operational decisions, **not missing application code**.

## Verified Railway Backend

- Project: `rakshex`
- Service: `rakshex-api`
- Public health URL: `https://rakshex-api-production.up.railway.app/api/health`
- Data services: Railway PostgreSQL and Redis
- Migration status: recorded migrations including universal control-plane and GitHub-installation schema

The backend is reachable and schema-ready. Full paid public launch still needs the remaining frontend env, live-payment (if monetizing), email, identity, monitoring, and legal-owner items above.

**Private beta / free self-serve: GO from code.**
