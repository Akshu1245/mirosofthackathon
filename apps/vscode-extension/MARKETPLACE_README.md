## What Rakshex Does

Rakshex scans your AI agent configurations, API collections, and LLM integrations directly inside VS Code to find:

- **Leaked API keys** in environment files and collections
- **Hidden token costs** from unoptimized LLM calls
- **Security misconfigurations** in agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen)
- **Compliance gaps** in AI-generated code
- **Shadow APIs** — endpoints your agents call that you forgot about

**Your source code never leaves your machine.** We scan metadata and configurations, not your proprietary code.

## Install

```bash
# From VS Code Marketplace
ext install rakshex.rakshex-vscode

# Or search "Rakshex" in the Extensions sidebar

## Features

### 🔍 Real-Time Security Scanning

Scan any API collection or AI agent configuration file with one click. Find leaked secrets, misconfigurations, and compliance issues instantly.

- Track LLM spend per project
- Identify expensive agent loops
- Flag unoptimized prompt patterns
- Forecast monthly API costs

### 🧠 AI Security Copilot

Ask natural language questions about your security posture:

- "What are my highest-risk findings?"
- "How do I fix this leaked API key?"
- "Which agents cost the most?"

### 📊 Security Dashboard

- Severity-ranked findings (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- Weekly cost summaries
- Scan history and trends
- Team sharing (Pro plan)

### ⚡ Auto-Fix Suggestions

One-click fixes for common issues:

- Rotate exposed credentials
- Add rate limiting headers
- Sanitize PII in prompts
- Encrypt sensitive parameters
