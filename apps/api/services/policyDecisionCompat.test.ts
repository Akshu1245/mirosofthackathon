/**
 * Differential guard over the two live policy engines.
 *
 * These tests do not assert that the engines agree — they don't, and pretending
 * otherwise would hide the problem. They assert that the *divergence is known
 * and handled*, so that the fail-open hazard described in
 * policyDecisionCompat.ts cannot silently reappear.
 *
 * The first block is the important one: it pins both engines' action
 * vocabularies. If someone adds an action to either engine, or renames one,
 * these fail loudly rather than letting an unmapped string reach an
 * enforcement check and fall through to "allowed".
