/**
 * Compatibility layer between the two policy engines that are live in this
 * codebase. Read this before touching any policy code.
 *
 * There are currently TWO functions named `evaluatePolicy`, with different
 * data models and — critically — different action vocabularies:
 *
 *   apps/api/engines/policyEngine.ts   allow | block | redact | alert_only | require_approval
 *   @rakshex/policy-engine             allow | deny  | redact | warn       | require_approval
 *
 * "block" and "deny" mean the same thing. So do "alert_only" and "warn".
 * Neither engine knows about the other's spelling.
 *
 * Why this file exists: `services/gateway/enforcement.ts` gates on
 * `decision.action === "deny"`. That is correct for the package engine it
 * calls today. But if an app-engine decision is ever routed through the same
 * check, `"block"` will not match `"deny"`, the condition falls through, and
 * the request is **allowed**. A vocabulary mismatch that fails open is the
 * worst possible failure mode for an enforcement point, and nothing in the
 * type system catches it — both types are just string unions that happen to
 * share the name `PolicyDecision`.
 *
 * So: never compare a policy action to a string literal directly. Use
 * `isBlocking()` / `normalizeAction()` here, which accept either vocabulary.
 *
 * This is a bridge, not a destination. The real fix is to converge on one
 * engine (see CLAUDE.md §5 item 0). Deleting this file is safe only once
 * that migration is done and one vocabulary is gone.
