};

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: "How long does setup take?",
    a: "Setup takes less than 5 minutes. You can import your Postman or OpenAPI collection to start scanning immediately, or integrate our SDK with a single line of code.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you store our API data?",
    a: "No. We do not store request or response bodies. All security scanning and PII detection is performed in-memory, and only metadata (such as paths, latency, and token counts) is persisted. For strict privacy requirements, we offer self-hosted deployment.",
  },
  {
    q: "What compliance standards do you support?",
    a: "RaksHex maps findings and audit events to control language from PCI DSS, SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria, HIPAA, OWASP API Top 10, and OWASP LLM Top 10, and can export that evidence for your auditors. A SOC 2 audit is in progress — we do not claim certification until it's complete and published.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does the kill switch work?",
    a: "You can configure budget thresholds, anomaly detection scores, or prompt injection blocks. When a policy is violated, RaksHex blocks further API calls to the LLM within milliseconds, preventing cost overruns and data leaks.",
  },
  {
    q: "What LLM providers do you support?",
    a: "We support all major providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Cohere, Mistral, Groq, and AWS Bedrock.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is RaksHex different from Snyk or Datadog?",
    a: "Snyk scans static code dependencies, and Datadog provides general APM metrics. RaksHex is built specifically for AI runtime governance—analyzing LLM inputs/outputs in real-time, detecting prompt injections, managing token budgets, and mapping anomalies to compliance clauses.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you support self-hosted deployment?",
    a: "Yes. We offer a Docker Compose setup and Kubernetes-friendly production compose for self-hosting within your private cloud or on-premise infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens when I exceed my plan limits?",
    a: "When you approach your plan limits, we send warning notifications. If you exceed them, we provide a grace period depending on your plan. For continued high usage, your account will be capped or you will be prompted to upgrade to a higher tier.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does thinking token attribution work?",
    a: "For models with reasoning tokens (like OpenAI o1/o3 or DeepSeek R1), RaksHex parses the raw API response, isolates the thinking tokens, and attributes their exact cost separately from standard output tokens.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is there a free trial for Pro?",
    a: "Yes. We offer a 14-day free trial for the Pro plan, with no credit card required. You can experience advanced scanning, Slack alerts, and team features immediately.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I export compliance reports?",
    a: "Yes. You can export complete, auditor-ready compliance reports and raw scan evidence in PDF, JSON, and CSV formats.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I integrate with GitHub Actions?",
    a: "You can use our official GitHub Action to automatically scan API collections and check for security regressions or shadow endpoints as part of your CI/CD pipeline.",
  },
];
