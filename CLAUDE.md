# RaksHex — agent handoff

**Last verified:** 2026-08-06 (every claim below was executed, not inferred)

Read this file first. It exists so you don't have to re-derive the state of the repo by
reading 10,000 files. Where a claim is unverified, it says so explicitly — trust the
labels, and re-run the commands in §2 before believing anything is still true.

---

## 1. What this is

pnpm + turbo monorepo. "AI agent and API security platform." Previously branded
**DevPulse** — that name is retired and a test (`apps/api/runtimeClaims.test.ts`) fails
the build if it reappears in shipped source.

The strategic positioning is the **Agent Firewall**: runtime authorization for
autonomous AI actions. The one-line differentiator, which is defensible and narrow:

> Competitors govern the *session*. RaksHex governs the *action*.

Concretely: semantic actions (`financial.refund`), delegated authority with
parent→child attenuation, a hash-chained tamper-evident Action Ledger, and
credential mediation so a DENY is enforceable rather than advisory.

- **API** — `apps/api`, Express + tRPC, port 3000
- **Web** — `apps/web`, Next.js, port 3001
- **Packages** — `packages/*`, all `workspace:*`

## 2. Verified state — run these to confirm

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm lint          # clean, --max-warnings=0
pnpm typecheck     # 18/18 packages
pnpm build         # 18/18
pnpm test:api      # 872 tests, 81 files (was 831 — +policy differential corpus, +SIEM export)
pnpm test:packages # 158 tests
```

With Postgres + Redis running (`docker compose up -d postgres redis`):

```bash
pnpm db:migrate       # 26 migrations
pnpm test:integration # 57 tests
pnpm test:db          # VERIFIED 2026-08-06 on real Postgres 18.4 — 10/10 pass, see §5 item 1
pnpm test:e2e         # NOT VERIFIED — needs API + web up
```

**As of 2026-08-05 the first two blocks pass.** The API boots against a live DB and
`/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok","db":"ok","redis":"ok","queue":"ok"}`.

> **Important history:** before 2026-08-05 this repo **did not typecheck** — 7
> pre-existing errors, including four calls to DB functions that did not exist. That
> means the CI typecheck gate was not being enforced. Several status docs asserted
> "code-complete and test-covered" while the build was broken. Seven of them were
> **deleted on 2026-08-05** (`MARKET_READY.md`, `MARKET_READINESS_LAUNCH_BAR.md`,
> `LAUNCH_BAR.md`, `PRODUCTION_READINESS_REPORT_2026-07-30.md`,
> `rakshex_verification_report.md`, `docs/MARKET_READY_COMPLETE.md`,
> `ARCHITECTURE_AUDIT.md`) because a future reader inheriting their false baseline is
> worse than having no status doc at all. **This file is now the only status doc.**
> `docs/FEATURE_MATURITY.md` and `docs/GAP_INVENTORY.md` survive but are still dated
> 2026-07-30 — treat them as marketing, not evidence. Some docs still contain dangling
> links to the deleted files; harmless, but fix on sight.

## 3. Completion, honestly

Percentages are meaningless without an axis, so here are four. Overall single number
if you must have one: **~72%** — but read the rows, because they disagree for good
reasons.

| Axis | % | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **Code exists & compiles** | ~95% | lint + typecheck + build all green, executed |
| **Verified by execution** | ~75% | 1046 tests pass; app boots; migrations apply/roll back; routes mounted |
| **Proven correct in domain terms** | ~40% | tests passing ≠ features behave correctly. ~20 of 296 API files have been read closely |
| **Business / ops / legal ready** | ~30% | legal review, pen test, live payment keys, SOC2, support all outstanding |

**Do not tell the user this is "100% market ready."** It is not, and the gap is
specific and listed in §5 — not vague.

### What is genuinely done and proven

- Agent Firewall core (`packages/action-control`) — 61 tests
- Credential mediation — service, schema, router, SDK, UI; 58 unit + 10 real-socket tests
- MCP adversarial-intent scanning — 11 tests
- All 26 migrations apply **and roll back**, verified on real Postgres 18.3
- Anti-replay is enforced by a **DB unique index**, proven by a failing duplicate insert
- App boots; every new tRPC route confirmed mounted and auth-gated

---

## 4. What changed recently (and why it matters)

### Security fix — attenuation bypass (`packages/action-control/src/authority.ts`)

`validateAttenuation()` accepted a child authority that **omitted** `resources` /
`environments`, and an omitted constraint means *unrestricted* at evaluation time —
so the child was strictly **broader** than its parent. This falsified the product's
headline claim. Fixed via two helpers with deliberately opposite semantics:

- `actionsCovered()` — empty list means **deny all** (restrictive)
- `constraintCovered()` — empty list means **no restriction** (permissive)

That asymmetry is the whole point. Do not "simplify" them back into one function.

> **Behaviour change:** existing authorities in a live DB that omit these fields under
> a scoped parent will now be **rejected**. Audit production data before deploying.

### Credential mediation (the enforcement story)

`apps/api/services/credentialBroker.ts` — all security decisions live in the **pure**
`authorizeBrokeredRequest()` so they are exhaustively testable. Router wiring is in
`apps/api/api/agentFirewall.ts` under `credentials`.

Non-obvious invariants, each of which has a test:

1. **Shadow-mode laundering.** In shadow mode `effectiveDecision` is ALLOW even for a
   DENY. Brokering on that alone would execute every denied action. The broker
   requires the **true `decision`** to be ALLOW too.
2. **Claim before spend.** The egress row is inserted *before* the secret is
   decrypted. The unique index on `ledger_id` means two racing calls cannot both win.
3. **No redirects.** `redirect: "manual"` — a 302 could send the credential to an
   unvetted host.
4. **Secret never leaves the server.** `credentials.list` uses an explicit column list,
   never `select()`. Never add `secretCiphertext` to a response.

### Missing DB functions implemented (`apps/api/db.ts`)

`getAuditLogForUserPage`, `getScansPageByCollectionId`, `saveScanWithFindings`,
`createWorkspaceWithOwner`, `getLatestComplianceScoresForUser`. The middle two are
**transactional** — their call sites always documented them as atomic but they did
not exist at all. Also: `recordTokenUsage` was silently discarding cost attribution
despite the columns existing since migration 0013.

## 5. Known gaps — start here

0. **TWO POLICY ENGINES ARE LIVE AT ONCE.** Found 2026-08-06. There are two
   different functions both called `evaluatePolicy`, with incompatible data
   models, both in active use on different request paths:

   - `apps/api/engines/policyEngine.ts` — `(event: AIEventContext, rules: PolicyRule[])`,
     a priority-sorted rule list where first match wins. Used by
     `middleware/policyEnforcement.ts`, `services/policyCache.ts`, `api/policies.ts`.
   - `packages/policy-engine` — `(policy: PolicyDocument | CompiledPolicy, ctx)`,
     a compiled policy document. Used by `services/gateway/enforcement.ts`
     and `services/policyAsCode.ts`.

   For a security product this is the most serious structural problem in the
   repo: **a policy authored in one model is invisible to the other**, so the
   answer to "is this action allowed?" depends on which entry point the
   request happened to take. A customer configuring a rule in the dashboard
   has no reason to expect it not to apply at the gateway. Nothing currently
   detects the divergence — both engines are individually tested and both
   pass.

   Do not "fix" this by deleting one at random; they encode different
   semantics and each has live call sites. It needs a deliberate decision
   about which model is canonical, then a migration of the other's call
   sites, ideally with a test that asserts both paths agree on a shared
   corpus of policies before either is removed.

   **Update 2026-08-06 — the corpus test now exists:**
   `apps/api/engines/policyEngine.differential.test.ts` runs 10 policy
   intents through both engines and normalizes the results through
   `services/policyDecisionCompat.ts`. **7 of 10 agree. 3 are asserted
   divergences**, and they are the actual scope of the migration, not a
   footnote:

   - **Network destination policy is unenforceable in the app engine.**
     `AIEventContext` has no field a rule can match a destination against —
     `getFieldValue()` falls through to `""` for any unrecognised field. A
     domain block that works via the package engine is a silent no-op via
     the app engine.
   - **Prompt threat level is unenforceable in the package engine.**
     `PolicyDocument` has no threat-level concept anywhere in its schema. A
     rule that blocks on the MCP adversarial-intent scanner's threat level
     cannot be represented as a `PolicyDocument` at all.
   - **Cross-category precedence is not the same relation.** The app engine
     lets a per-rule `priority` beat another rule regardless of category (a
     tool rule ranked above a model rule wins). The package engine hardcodes
     category order (models before tools, no override). Identical facts,
     opposite decision, depending only on which engine handles the request —
     this is the fail-open hazard from the paragraph above, demonstrated
     rather than asserted.

   **What this means for "migrate to one engine":** it is not a rename.
   The package engine's schema has no slot for threat-level or free-form
   telemetry conditions, and no per-rule priority. Migrating the app
   engine's call sites onto the package engine today would silently drop
   both threat-level policies and any priority-based rule that currently
   overrides a category. Either extend `PolicyDocument`'s schema first, or
   accept and document the loss explicitly before switching call sites —
   do not switch call sites and assume parity. The migration itself has
   **not** been started.

1. ~~`pnpm test:db` / `foundation.test.ts` — UNVERIFIED.~~ **VERIFIED 2026-08-06 on
   real Postgres 18.4 — 10/10 pass.** The earlier 6 PGlite failures
   (`Received unexpected rowDescription message from backend`) were confirmed as a
   **PGlite wire-protocol emulation bug**, not a schema defect: same migrations, same
   seed, same test file, zero failures under real Postgres. See §6 for how to get a
   real (non-WASM) Postgres in a sandbox with no root and no Docker — the
   `embedded-postgres` npm package ships native binaries and needs neither.
2. **No authenticated end-to-end broker call.** Route existence and anonymous
   rejection are proven; the full path (sign in → store credential → evaluate → broker
   → egress row) is not. Needs user/workspace/session seeding.
3. **Playwright E2E never run** — needs API + web + DB together.
4. **Ops/legal** — pen test, legal review, live payment keys, `RAKSHEX_VAULT_KEY` in
   the deploy environment.

`RAKSHEX_VAULT_KEY` is now **load-bearing**: `credentials.create` fails closed without
it. Wired into `.env.example`, `render.yaml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

## 6. Gotchas that will cost you an hour

- **Migrations are driven by a hardcoded `MIGRATION_ORDER` array** in
  `packages/database/src/migrate.ts` — *not* drizzle-kit's journal, which is stale and
  abandoned after 0001. **A new `.sql` file that isn't added to that array silently
  never runs.** This has already caused a production-shaped bug once.
- There are **two `0012_` migrations** (compliance_report_types, workspace_subscriptions).
  Intentional, ordered by file date. Don't "fix" it.
- `apps/api/tsconfig.json` runs `strict: false`. Wrong-arity and wrong-order function
  calls can slip through review. **Check signatures; don't trust the type checker.**
  `requireWorkspacePermission(workspaceId, userId, resource, action)` — that order,
  four args. `requireWorkspaceMembership(workspaceId, userId)`.
- New `logSecurityEvent` strings must be added to the `SecurityEventType` union in
  `apps/api/services/securityEvents.ts` or typecheck fails.
- Workspace packages must be added to **both** `tsconfig.base.json` and
  `apps/api/tsconfig.json` `paths`.
- The `report_type` enum value is **`pci_dss`**, not `pci`.
- `apps/api/runtimeClaims.test.ts` fails the build on retired brand names and
  unverifiable superiority claims ("India's first", "world-first"). It is a
  **legal guardrail** — fix the copy, don't weaken the test.

### If you're in a sandboxed environment

- Bulk `rsync`/`cp` of the whole repo over a mounted FS times out.
  `tar cf - --exclude=node_modules | tar xf -` into `/tmp` works.
- turbo needs `pnpm` on `PATH`; a `corepack pnpm@10.32.1 "$@"` shim works.
- No root, so no apt Postgres. Two options, and they are not interchangeable:
  - **`@electric-sql/pglite`** gives you Postgres 18 compiled to **WASM**, and
    `@electric-sql/pglite-socket` exposes it over TCP so the real `pg` driver
    connects. Good enough for migrations and most integration tests. **Not** good
    enough for `foundation.test.ts` — 6 tests fail with
    `Received unexpected rowDescription message from backend`, a wire-protocol
    emulation gap in PGlite itself.
  - **`embedded-postgres`** (npm) ships **real native Postgres binaries** per
    platform and runs `initdb`/`pg_ctl` as the current user — no root, no Docker.
    This is what actually resolved `foundation.test.ts` (see §5 item 1, verified
    2026-08-06): `new EmbeddedPostgres({ databaseDir, user, password, port,
    persistent: false }); await pg.initialise(); await pg.start();` then point
    `DATABASE_URL` at it. Prefer this over PGlite whenever a test's failure mode
    is ambiguous between "real bug" and "emulator gap" — it removes the emulator
    as a variable entirely.
- Each bash call is a fresh PID namespace — background servers do not survive between
  calls. Start the server and run the tests in **one** invocation (wrap start →
  migrate/test → `pg.stop()` in a single Node script, not separate bash calls).
- The API boots in dev with `REDIS_URL=""` (falls back to in-memory MockRedis).
  Required env to boot: `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` (32+ chars), `RAKSHEX_VAULT_KEY`.

## 7. Working agreement

The user is the founder and moves fast. They have said "I agree with everything you
say" — **do not take that as licence.** Multiple real bugs in this codebase were
introduced by confident, plausible-looking code, including by prior agents. Two were
introduced during the session that produced this file and caught only by checking
actual function signatures against the source.

State confidence honestly, lead with the uncomfortable finding, and verify by
executing rather than by reading. When you can't verify something, say so plainly and
name the command that would settle it.
